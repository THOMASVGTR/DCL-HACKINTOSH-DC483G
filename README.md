Download [Clover.img, CloverBootDiskCreator.exe  and OSX_10.14.0_Installer.hfs ] files from this drive link.

# 8GB USB FLASH DRIVE or above recommended. And also Windows 7,8,8.1,10 or 11

# Run cloverBootDiskCreator.exe after connecting USB drive to PC/Laptop.
# Select clover.img and OSX HFS files you have downloaded. Then write these into the USB drive with cloverBootDiskCreator.
# After all of these you will find a 200MB drive/partition named as 'CLOVER' or 'USB DRIVE'. 
# macOS is already written on your USB drive so don't worry.

# NOW DELETE ALL FILES INSIDE FROM THE drive/partition named as 'CLOVER' or 'USB DRIVE'.

# Now copy my OPENCORE FOLDER IN IT. COPY FULL 'EFI' FOLDER. NOT FROM 'BOOT' and 'OC' Folders. From 'EFI' folder.

# Now your macOS bootable USB is created and fully ready to boot on DCL-DC483G Laptop.

# DO EVERYTHING AT YOUR OWN RISK. BACKUP IMPORTANT DATA FIRST BEFORE INSTALLING macOS. All the best.

# Credit goes to Apple for macOS/OSX, Opencore developers & all hackers and developers for creating patches and drivers(kexts).
